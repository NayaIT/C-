/*04. Print a Deck
Write a program that reads a card sign(as a char) from the console and generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards up to the card with the given sign(without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).

The card faces should start from 2 to A.
Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.

/*07. Calculate 3!
In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose N different members out of a group of N different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: formula For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards. Your task is to write a program that calculates N! / (K! * (N - K)!) for given N and K.
Try to use only two loops.
